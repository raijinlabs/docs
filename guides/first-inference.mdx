# Your First Inference

This guide walks you through running an AI inference and verifying the cryptographic receipt.

## Prerequisites

- A Lucid API key ([get one here](https://app.lucid.foundation))
- Node.js 18+ installed
- `raijin-labs-lucid-ai` SDK installed

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    ```typescript
    import { LucidAI } from "raijin-labs-lucid-ai";

    const lucid = new LucidAI({
      bearerAuth: process.env.LUCID_API_KEY,
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send a chat completion">
    ```typescript
    const response = await lucid.chat.completions({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "What is verifiable AI inference?" }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the receipt">
    ```typescript
    // The receipt ID is returned in the response
    const receiptId = response.receiptId;
    const receipt = await lucid.receipts.get(receiptId);

    console.log("Receipt ID:", receipt.id);
    console.log("Input hash:", receipt.inputHash);
    console.log("Output hash:", receipt.outputHash);
    console.log("Epoch:", receipt.epochId);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the receipt">
    ```typescript
    const verification = await lucid.receipts.verify(receiptId);

    console.log("Signature valid:", verification.signatureValid);
    console.log("MMR proof valid:", verification.proofValid);
    console.log("Overall valid:", verification.valid);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The receipt is created automatically — no extra API call needed during inference.
</Tip>

## What Happened

1. Your request was **matched** to the best available model
2. The LLM processed your request
3. A **cryptographic receipt** was generated with SHA-256 hashes of input/output
4. The receipt was **signed** by the session signer (Ed25519)
5. The receipt was added to the current **epoch's MMR**
6. The epoch will be **anchored on Solana** when it closes

## Next Steps

- [Passport Management](/guides/passport-management) — Create and manage identities
- [Verifiable Receipts](/guides/verifiable-receipts) — Deep-dive into the receipt system
- [Streaming](/guides/streaming) — Use server-sent events for real-time responses
