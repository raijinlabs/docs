# CrewAI Integration

Build multi-agent systems using CrewAI with Lucid's verifiable infrastructure.

## Setup

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from lucid import LucidProvider

# Use Lucid as the LLM provider
provider = LucidProvider(api_key="your-key")

researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information",
    llm=provider.get_model("gpt-4o")
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Create compelling content",
    llm=provider.get_model("claude-3-sonnet")
)
```

## Verifiable Crews

Every agent action generates a Lucid receipt, creating a full audit trail of the multi-agent collaboration.
