# Claude Code Integration

Connect Lucid to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) using MCP.

## Setup

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lucid": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@raijinlabs/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "LUCID_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What You Can Do

- Query the Lucid API from Claude Code conversations
- Search for models and agents in the passport registry
