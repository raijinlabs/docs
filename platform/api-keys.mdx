## Create a Key

1. Go to [Dashboard → Settings → API Keys](https://app.lucid.foundation/settings/keys)
2. Click **Create Key**
3. Set permissions and expiration
4. Copy the key (shown only once)

## Key Scopes

| Scope             | Description                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `passports:read`  | List and get passports           |
| `passports:write` | Create, update, delete passports |
| `inference:run`   | Run chat completions             |
| `receipts:read`   | Get and verify receipts          |
| `admin`           | Full access                      |

## Rotate Keys

```typescript
// Old key continues working for 24 hours after rotation
await lucid.keys.rotate(keyId);
```

## Best Practices

- Use separate keys for production and development
- Set the minimum required scopes
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never commit keys to source control
