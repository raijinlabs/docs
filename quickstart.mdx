<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Sign up at [app.lucid.foundation](https://app.lucid.foundation) and create an API key from the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm install raijin-labs-lucid-ai
    ```

    
    ```bash yarn
    yarn add raijin-labs-lucid-ai
    ```

    
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add raijin-labs-lucid-ai
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the client">
    ```typescript
    import { LucidAI } from "raijin-labs-lucid-ai";
    
    const lucid = new LucidAI({
      bearerAuth: process.env.LUCID_API_KEY,
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="List your passports">
    ```typescript
    const passports = await lucid.passports.list();
    console.log(`Found ${passports.length} passports`);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run an inference">
    ```typescript
    const response = await lucid.chat.completions({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "What is verifiable AI?" }
      ]
    });
    
    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
    // Receipt ID is in response headers
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the receipt">
    ```typescript
    const receipt = await lucid.receipts.get(receiptId);
    const verification = await lucid.receipts.verify(receiptId);
    
    console.log("Verified:", verification.valid);
    console.log("Merkle proof:", verification.proof);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The SDK is generated by [Speakeasy](https://speakeasyapi.dev/) and includes full TypeScript types for every endpoint.

## What just happened?

1. **Passport lookup** — Your API key resolved to a passport identity
2. **Policy matching** — Lucid matched your request to the best available model
3. **Inference** — The LLM processed your request
4. **Receipt creation** — A cryptographic receipt was generated with an MMR proof
5. **Epoch anchoring** — The receipt will be batched and anchored on Solana
