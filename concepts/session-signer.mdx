# Session Signer

The **Session Signer** is a server-side Ed25519 keypair that signs every receipt, providing cryptographic authenticity.

## How It Works

1. When a receipt is created, the signer generates an Ed25519 signature
2. The signature covers: `receipt_id || input_hash || output_hash || timestamp`
3. Anyone can verify the signature using the signer's public key

## Get the Public Key

```typescript
const { publicKey } = await lucid.signer.pubkey();
// Use this to verify signatures offline
```

## Verify a Signature

```typescript
import { verify } from "@noble/ed25519";

const receipt = await lucid.receipts.get(receiptId);
const { publicKey } = await lucid.signer.pubkey();

const message = Buffer.concat([
  Buffer.from(receipt.id),
  Buffer.from(receipt.inputHash),
  Buffer.from(receipt.outputHash),
  Buffer.from(receipt.timestamp)
]);

const valid = await verify(receipt.signature, message, publicKey);
```

## Security Model

- The signer key is managed server-side (not exposed to clients)
- Key rotation is supported (old signatures remain valid with the old key)
- The public key is always available via the API
