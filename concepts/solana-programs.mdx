# Solana Programs

Lucid has two Solana programs written in Rust:

## lucid-receipts

Stores epoch MMR roots on-chain. Each anchored epoch creates a Solana account containing:

- **Epoch ID** — Sequential identifier
- **MMR Root** — The Merkle Mountain Range root hash
- **Timestamp** — When the epoch was anchored
- **Receipt Count** — Number of receipts in the epoch

### Verification

Anyone can verify a receipt by:
1. Getting the receipt's MMR proof from the API
2. Fetching the epoch's on-chain MMR root from Solana
3. Verifying the proof against the root

## lucid-registry

Manages passport registration on-chain:

- **Passport accounts** — On-chain representation of passports
- **Ownership** — Links passports to Solana wallets
- **Metadata** — Type, capabilities, status

## Program IDs

| Program | Devnet | Mainnet |
|---------|--------|---------|
| lucid-receipts | `LRec...` | TBD |
| lucid-registry | `LReg...` | TBD |

## Gas Utils

The `gas-utils` program handles CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) for gas-efficient operations across both programs.
